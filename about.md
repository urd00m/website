&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Alan Wang, a first year PhD student researching hardware security at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) advised by [Profesor Chris Fletcher](https://cwfletcher.github.io/). My main focus is side channel attacks and defenses (hardware and software). Specifically, I focus on Spectre attacks and mobile microarchitectural security. I occasionally will dabble in computer systems research. Outside of research, I play soccer, swim, and poorly play volleyball.  

<h2>What I do in the Summers</h2>
- This past summer ('25), I visited Seattle, Los Angeles, Alaska, Iceland, Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia! They were all very beautiful (Iceland has been my favorite).  
- In the summer of '24, I was working as a software developer intern at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) where I worked on systems critical to supporting the trading effort.  
- In the summer of '23, I was a computer science intern at [D.E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/) doing research on docking and writing embedded code that ran on the Anton3 ASIC!  
- In the summer of '22, I was a research aide at Argonne National Laboratory working on a potpourri of things.  
- In the summer of '21, I was a research intern at Argonne National Laboratory working on robotics for drug discovery.  
- In the summer of '20 and '19, I was an intern at the Navy building an autonomous bomb defusing robot.

  Fun Fact: I have some presence on scratch.mit.edu. I leave as an exercise to the reader to find out who I am on scratch though (:
