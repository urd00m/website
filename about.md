&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Alan Wang, a Senior/Masters student studying computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I'm currently pursuing a conjoined bachelor/master (BSMS) degree with a anticipated graduation date of 2025. At UIUC I do computer security research with [Profesor Chris Fletcher](https://cwfletcher.github.io/) where my main focus is side channel attacks and defenses (hardware and software). Outside of research, I was the swim coordinator for the Fighting Illini Triathlon (FIT), an intramural soccer + volleyball player, and occasional chess enjoyer.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past summer ('24) I was working as a software developer intern at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) where I worked on systems critical to supporting the trading effort. In the summer of '23 I was a computer science intern at [D.E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/) doing research on docking and writing embedded code that ran on the Anton3 ASIC!

  Fun Fact: I have some presence on scratch.mit.edu. I leave as an exercise to the reader to find out who I am on scratch though (:
