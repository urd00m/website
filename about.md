&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Alan Wang, a Junior studying computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I'm currently pursuing a bachelor (BS) degree but planning on pursuing a BS/MS conjoined degree (pending acceptance). At UIUC I do computer security research with [Profesor Fletcher](https://cwfletcher.github.io/) where my main focus is side channel attacks and defenses (hardware and software). Outside of research, I am the swim coordinator for the Fighting Illini Triathlon (FIT), an intramural soccer player on the team Ankle Insurance, and a member of the Illinois Space Society RASC-AL team.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past summer ('23) I was working as a computer science intern at D.E. Shaw Research doing research on docking and writing embedded code that ran on the Anton3 ASIC! For next summer I'm still looking around :)

  Fun Fact: I'm kind of famous on scratch.mit.edu. I leave as an exercise to the reader to find out who I am on scratch though (:
