title: Creating This Site :D
---

After much debating I have decided to make a website. This site is built on the Jekyll Lanyon theme, you can find the template [here](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). 

The bugs <i class="fa fa-bug" style="color: #000000;"></i>
* After an hour of playing around with [fontawesome](https://aksakalli.github.io/jekyll-doc-theme/docs/font-awesome/) I finally got icons (but they aren't animiated sadly)
* I didn't like the blog being on the homepage so I moved it to a "blog" page. To my surprise after doing this for each blog post it would add a new link to the side bar navigation. That was rather annoying to try to fix...
* I tried to crop my profile picture to be circular. After searching around to do this in HTML I coudn't find anything (i.e. I found how to do it but didn't want to do it that way). So I did what any sane person would have started with and just cropped the image using this [site](https://crop-circle.imageonline.co/). 
* Turns out __ doesn't do italics but this _ does :\
* Still need to add the papers I've read hehe 
* I also need to upgrade my favicon, it's a little basic and I used this [site](https://favicon.io/) to create it. 
* I'm sure there is more somewhere...
