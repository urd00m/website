Pictures from visiting the darksite! Very cool! 

Just a note if you click this button -> **[here](/2023/09/16/dark-site)** <- it will dark out the screen to make it easier to the dark pictures see ;)  

THIS TOOK FOREVER TO IMPLEMENT OMG. --> I had to create a custom theme and have it only switch to that dark theme, for some reason the title and my name kept dissappear so that also took some hacking.
