The energy drink I had started to come up on the run and that completely tanked my performance on the run :(. For the future I know I need to bring some more water to dilute it so that doesn't happen again (target pace was 8 minute miles but ended up being around ~11). My swim and bike times were right where I wanted them to be though.
